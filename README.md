# Automated Version Control Process
## In Progress
Personal project currently in development by Thomas Weaver

The **purpose** of this project is to provide simple **Version Control (VC)** capabilities with a moderate learning curve to any development team lacking a company-provided VC platform. The **scope** of this project will include several executable Python scripts to be used within a shared drive/directory to initiate and access project repositories. This will provide teams with a simple, automated VC process with minimal user input.

## System Requirements

- A shared drive/directory to host the repository.

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git).
