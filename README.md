# Automated Version Control Process
Personal project currently in development by Thomas Weaver

The **purpose** of this project is to provide simple **Version Control (VC)** capabilities with a moderate learning curve to any development team lacking a company-provided VC platform, such as GitHub or GitBucket. The **scope** of this project will include several executable Python scripts accessible by team members for various purposes, such as cloning a repo to their local device and committing changes at the end of each day. This will provide teams with a simple, automated VC process with minimal user input.

## System Requirements

- A shared drive/directory to host the repository.

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git).
